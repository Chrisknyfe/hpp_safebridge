	<h2>
	Self-care is about taking steps to feel healthy and comfortable. Whether it happened recently or years ago, self-care can help you cope with the short- and long-term effects of a trauma like sexual assault.</h2><br>
	
	<p><b>Physical self-care</b></p><br>
	After a trauma, itâ€™s important to keep your body healthy and strong. You may be healing from injuries or feeling emotionally drained. Good physical health can support you through this time. Consider asking yourself the following questions:<br>
	
	<p>How are you sleeping? Do you have a sleep ritual or nap pattern that makes you feel more rested?</p><br>
	What types of food are you eating? What meals make you feel healthy and strong?<br>
	What types of exercise do you enjoy? Are there any particular activities that make you feel more energized?<br>
	
	<p><b>Emotional self-care</b></p><br>
	Emotional self-care means different things to different people. The key to emotional self-care is being in tune with yourself. Think about a time when you felt balanced and grounded, and consider asking yourself the following questions:<br>
	
	<p>What fun or leisure activities do you enjoy?<br>
	Are meditation or relaxation activities a part of your regular schedule?<br>
	Who do you spend time with? Was there someone, or a group of people, that you felt safe and supported around?<br>
