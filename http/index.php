								<strong>Build safe learning environments and residential communities with data-driven campus reporting.</strong>
								<p>SafeBridge generates automated reports based on anonymous user data to inform the school of campus climate, safety, and student community health.  This data can provide quantitative data on rates and classification of incidents, circumstances of incidents, and utilization of on-campus resources.</p>
